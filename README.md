*Room Tile Dungeon Crawler Project*

-- General Idea


Top of page is a nav of sorts with options, 

** Character sheet with stats and inventory, needed

** Text output of story, paired with dialogue boxes and options in the form of buttons

** Set of room objects, with properties and methods for navigation and possibly fights / chest looting

** Sprites to represent various entities

** Web formatting, html and CSS to serve as GUI for dungeon crawler, fitting rough outline of wireframe

** Figure out cookies and how to import JS logic to website

** Figure out hosting- nevermind

** Map GUI needs to be updated as player moves around, each room is object with explored boolean that updates to div ?? on map 

** Character object populated with user input, so character setup dialogue at the beginning, maybe tied to a room

** Story map, rooms follow from that, order # 1 of business

** Write database of rooms, each room ought to have an identifying number, and a set position relative to other rooms, such that referencing a direction will allow the number/name of the rome to be moved to to be referenced 

** Database of monster to fight objects, stats laid out, loot drops

** database of items, ability to be placed in or referenced from chests and monsters, health potions

** Locked door key system, key object as drop

** Combat -- attack options, turn based, health meter, updates

** Multiple floors, map logic built in for each floor.

** Goal is to escape
